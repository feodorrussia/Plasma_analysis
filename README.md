# Plasma Analysis project

#### ðŸŒ± The project was created as part of the research at the Scientific Laboratory of Advanced Plasma Research Methods for Spherical Tokamaks at Peter the Great St. Petersburg State University on the Globe-M2 tokamak.

## Abstract

Processing a large amount of plasma diagnostic data is crucial for scientific research in the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion. 
This project aims to automate the processing of diagnostic signals in real-time. To achieve this goal, various approaches have been explored. 
Filtering algorithms based on static analysis, with modifications for threshold setting, as well as Bayesian and neural network techniques, have been considered.
